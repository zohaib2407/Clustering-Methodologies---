# Market segmentation study - Clustering-Methodologies
A demonstration on working of different clustering methodologies.

**Purpose**
The better and more effective market segmentation would enable to design more cost-effective promotions
targeted at appropriate segments. Thus, multiple promotions could be launched, each targeted at different market segments
at different times of a year. This would result in a more cost-effective allocation of the promotion budget to different market segments.

**Data**
Household data: (each row is a household); demographics of household, purchase data (updated monthly).of product
categories and brands
We would segment the market based on purchase behavior (volume, frequency, susceptibility to discounts, and brand loyalty).

**Techniques**
In this analysis we will be going through 3 different techniques for clustering structured data.
1.K-means clustering 2.Heirarchial clustering 3.Density based clustering (DBSCAN)
